        "description": "It’s the end of 2025 and to celebrate I thought I’d run through some of the best lessons I’ve picked up over the last 12 months. This year has had over 10,000 minutes of episodes produced so there was a lot to choose from but I ended up settling on 23 insights from some of my favourite conversations, both inside and outside of the podcast. Expect to learn why I try to stay out of internet drama, how not to care about what other people think of you, why you shouldn't have shame in small fears,  how to use vulnerability to your advantage and show true strength, why procrastination is often about fear, what the Atlas Complex, Input-Output Delusion and The Anorexic Hermit Crab is, and much more...

Ideas that once lived outside the mainstream have quickly entered the Overton Window, while others have been pushed out. So what does the future hold for “woke”? Is it fading, primed for a resurgence, or simply mutating into the next cultural battleground?

        "description": "To celebrate 999, almost 1000, episodes of Modern Wisdom, I broke down some of my favourite lessons, insights and quotes from the last hundred episodes.  Expect to learn how 999 episodes of Modern Wisdom have reshaped my understanding of happiness, success and relationships, what i've learned on losing points from Naval Ravikant & Roger Federer, the best isnights on self-belief from Vincent van Gogh, what Viktor Frankl’s paradox of meaning versus pleasure means to me, the biggest insights I've gained over 7 years and 1 billion plays, why lowering your threshold for joy makes you stronger, how busyness can act as an emotional gastric band, the paradox men face between ambition and self-acceptance, how our culture rewires romantic attraction around emotional unavailability, and much more...
