(1:00) It must have been frustrating for these elite athletes, who wanted to get on the court and show what they could do, to arrive at practice for the first time with this legendary coach only to hear him say, Today we will learn to tie our shoes.    The point Wooden was making was that creating effective habits, down to the smallest detail, is what makes the difference between winning and losing games.    Each habit might seem small, but added together, they have an exponential effect on performance.   Just one habit, at the top of any field, can be enough to give an edge over the competition.    (8:41) Faith allows you to trust the direction without needing to understand it.   (10:16) If you make the choice of reading classic literature every day for a year, rather than reading the news, by the end of that time period you’ll have a more honed sensitivity for recognizing greatness from the books than from the media.   This applies to every choice we make. The friends we choose, the conversations we have, even the thoughts we reflect on. All of these aspects affect our ability to distinguish good from very good, very good from great. They help us determine what’s worthy of our time and attention.   Because there’s an endless amount of data available to us and we have a limited bandwidth to conserve, we might consider carefully curating the quality of what we allow in.   (14:25) We’re affected by our surroundings, and finding the best environment to create a clear channel is personal and to be tested.   (27:57) Rules direct us to average behaviors. If we’re aiming to create works that are exceptional, most rules don’t apply. Average is nothing to aspire to. The goal is not to fit in. Communicate your singular perspective.   (28:30) It’s a healthy practice to approach our work with as few accepted rules, starting points, and limitations as possible. Often the standards in our chosen medium are so ubiquitous, we take them for granted. They are invisible and unquestioned.   (29:00) The world isn’t waiting for more of the same. Often, the most innovative ideas come from those who master the rules to such a degree that they can see past them or from those who never learned them at all.   (38:50) Fear of criticism. Attachment to a commercial result. Competing with past work. Time and resource constraints. The aspiration of wanting to change the world. And any story beyond “I want to make the best thing I can make, whatever it is” are all undermining forces in the quest for greatness.   (42:32) To hone your craft is to honor creation. By practicing to improve, you are fulfilling your ultimate purpose on this planet.",

        "description": "A viciously unhappy childhood causes Bruce Springsteen to retreat into work in an extreme way as he searches for success (and control). He channels his pain into focus and drive and gets everything he thought he wanted. He didn’t yet know he was lying to himself. He will find that out soon. He falls into a deep depression. One that almost leads to s*icide. With the help of his true friend Jon Landau he seeks professional help. This help helps immediately. The lie he was telling himself was that work was the most important thing in his life. What he really wanted, was what he was incapable of doing: forming a lasting and loving relationship with a woman. For that he realizes he can’t run. For that he realizes he has to stay. That thought terrifies him and is what caused him to seek help. He meets a truly singular woman and for the first time in his life he's able to have a healthy relationship with someone he loves. This realization comes almost 400 pages into Bruce’s incredible autobiography (one of the best I’ve ever read) and it is shocking. I originally thought I was making an episode about Bruce Springsteen’s extreme work ethic (one example: He wrote this book out by hand, multiple times, over 7 years. It’s almost 600 pages. He’s like this with everything btw.) But as I read, and reread this book over the last 6 months I realized that is not the most important part of the story. The work Bruce had to do to fix his mind is the heart and soul of the book. The work he did with Dr. Wayne Myers over 25 years is what allowed him to have a life. Not just a job. A life.  As Bruce says after coming through the other side of this: “Work is work . . . but life . . . is life . . . and life trumps art . . . always.”  This is a very unusual episode of Founders. I hope you enjoy it. If you want to skip to the part where he starts dealing with the struggles going on in his mind that starts 46 minutes in.

        "description": "I'm reposting one of my favorite founder stories. If you listened to this first time I recommend listening again. If you missed this before, you're about to hear one of the wildest founder stories of all time.  A few surprising things I learned from reading about Dietrich Mateschitz, founder of Red Bull:   1.  He started the company when he was 41 years old.  2.  He was making $500 to $800 million a year and his 49% stake is worth $20 to $30 billion.  3.  He still prioritized fitness deep into his 70s and liked driving fast, piloting his planes, and competing in off-road motorcycle races.   4.  The company was started with just $500,000 from Mateschitz and $500,000 from his partner. Outside of a small loan from a local bank all other expansion was funded by profits.   5.  The company reached profitability in its 3rd year and has been profitable every year since. (33 years and counting)  6.  He took no dividends for the first 13 years and reinvested all profits into growth instead   7.  He viewed Red Bull as a “marketing conglomerate” and tried to outsource everything else  8. He was intensely private. When an author tried to interview his elderly mother for an unauthorized biography. Mateschitz threatened to have his knee caps broken. He said it would only cost $500 to hire a Russian to do the job.   9.  There are no biographies written in English about Mateschitz.   10.  He believed a handshake agreement among gentlemen was sufficient and regularly did business with trusted partners with no written contract.   11.  He bought a popular Austrian magazine just so he wouldn’t appear in it.  12.  He was universally described by former employees as a gentleman, charismatic, and fiercely loyal.   13.  He didn’t like spending time socializing. He said:   “I don't believe in 50 friends. I believe in a smaller number. Nor do I care about society events. It's the most senseless use of time. When I do go out, from time to time, it's just to convince myself again that I'm not missing a lot.\"  14.  He owned a private island in Fiji and said he was attracted to having his own independent state.  His state would have the shortest set of laws in the world:   “The rules are simple: Nobody tells you what you have to do — only what you don’t have to do.”   15.  When he was asked if he was going to retire he said “I’m having more fun than ever.”   16.  He refused to sell Red Bull or take it public and worked on it until he died.

Baime Selected highlights:  1. He who travels fast, carries little. 2. All masterpieces bespeaks the character of its creator 3. \"When the driver steps on the gas I want him to shit his pants.\" 4.  It is obvious that a Ferrari is the product of a sort of automotive watch-maker. 5.  Ferrari has never taken a vacation in his life. 6. Racing is a profession for men who do not wish to die in bed.  7. If there was one essential quality about the man it was his ironbound tenacity, his fierce devotion to the single cause of winning automobile races with cars bearing his name. From 1930 onward, for nearly sixty years, hardly a day passed when this thought was not foremost in his mind. Win or lose, he unfailingly answered the bell. In that sense his devotion to his own self-described mission was without precedent. For that alone he towered over his peers. 8. “I was back where I had started. No money, no experience, limited education. All I had was a passion to get somewhere.” 9.  Ferrari had two fundamental talents. He was an agitator of men and he was an absolute marketing genius.  10.  \"A Ferrari must be desired. It cannot and must not be perceived as something that is immediately available; otherwise, the dream is gone.\" 11.  \"I have never considered myself a designer or an inventor, but only one who gets things moving and keeps them running. My innate talent was for stirring up men.\" 12. Enzo Ferrari was the consummate manager of men— not docile, soft men, but proud, fiercely competitive, egocentric men.  13. He was a pathological competitor. A man with a diamond-hard will to win at all costs. 14.  When asked how he wanted to be remembered, he replied: \"As someone who dreamt of becoming Ferrari.\" 15.  Ferrari was animated by an extraordinary passion that led him to build a product with no equal. 16. \"I had the stubborn determination to capture the trust of those who work with me.\"  17. “I should not have married because a man dominated by a passion such as mine, can hardly divide himself in half and be a good husband. If I had listened to my wife, I would have been a clerk in a bus company.” 18. He understood that showmanship is salesmanship.  19.  They were cars built by Italian artisans, every detail down to the steering wheel handcrafted using some of the same methods used to make Roman suits of armor and the royal carriages of the ancient kingdoms. 20.  When asked about the root of his mania, his obsession with victory, Ferrari said, \"Everything that I've  done, I did because I couldn't do anything less. One day I want to build a car that's faster than all of them, and then I want to die.\"",

        "description": "Your family asks you to take over a failing factory in a remote part of France. This “family business” comes with a stack of unpaid bills, a small team of workers who haven’t been paid in months, and a banker refusing to extend any more credit. You cut every unprofitable product and go all in on making rubber tires. You have no experience and don’t know a single thing about rubber manufacturing. You have a genius insight that selling tires is a waste of time and instead you should create the conditions for your product’s success. You organize the entire company around this core loop: encourage more driving → which leads to more movement → more movement leads to more wear → more wear leads to more tire sales. A simple and beautiful organizing principle emerges: a tire company will prosper if people travel more, so let’s help them do that. You make promiscuous use of the press. You write columns advertising the joys of the new activity of driving. You draw the maps, create the routes, and build thousands of road signs across France. All for free. Why? Because better signage means longer trips, more driving, and more tires sold. You publish the Michelin Guide — a free travel book with locations of hotels, restaurants, mechanics, and sites to see. You create the Michelin stars which become the global gold standard in fine dining and help people travel far for great food.  You stimulate demand through spectacle. You sponsor races, airshows, and contests with cash prizes. You make smart bets early so by the time cars appear in large numbers you already own the roads. You create the most successful company mascot of all time and create a family dynasty that lasts 100 years.  You're not one person, but two.

You go to great — almost absurd — lengths to control everything about your business. You have no outside shareholders and no debt. You commute by helicopter so you can perform quality control in person. You insist on constant customer contact and invent new ways to collect information from the customers you obsess over. You build your own machines, control all of your raw materials, and invest so heavily in distribution and logistics that you own the largest private fleet of vehicles in Italy, second only to the Italian army. You love your business and don’t want to spend time doing anything else. When you propose to your wife you tell her that she is marrying a man who will always talk to her about chocolate.

The petrochemical revolution gave us free energy—free mechanical energy, in this case. It changed the texture of society in most ways. This revolution, the information revolution, is a revolution of free energy as well, but of another kind: free intellectual energy. This revolution will dwarf the petrochemical revolution. We’re on the forefront.   A computer is the most incredible tool we’ve ever seen. It can be a writing tool, a communications center, a supercalculator, a planner, a filer and an artistic instrument all in one, just by being given new instructions, or software, to work from. There are no other tools that have the power and versatility of a computer. We have no idea how far it’s going to go    The hard part of what we’re up against now is that people ask you about specifics and you can’t tell them. A hundred years ago, if somebody had asked Alexander Graham Bell, “What are you going to be able to do with a telephone?” he wouldn’t have been able to tell him the ways the telephone would affect the world. He didn’t know that people would use the telephone to call up and find out what movies were playing that night or to order some groceries or call a relative on the other side of the globe. That is what Macintosh is all about. It’s the first “telephone” of our industry.   Ad campaigns are necessary for competition; IBM’s ads are everywhere. But good PR educates people; that’s all it is. You can’t con people in this business. The products speak for themselves.   We didn’t build Mac for anybody else. We built it for ourselves. We were the group of people who were going to judge whether it was great or not. We weren’t going to go out and do market research. We just wanted to build the best thing we could build. When you’re a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you’re not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it. You’ll know it’s there, so you’re going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back. For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through.

It's not easy to work here but we are working to build something important, something that matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren't meant to be easy.( 24:00 ) We believe we have reached a \"tipping point,\" where this platform allows us to launch new ecommerce businesses faster, with a higher quality of customer experience, a lower incremental cost, a higher chance of success, and a faster path to scale and profitability than any other company.( 27:00 ) We will continue to invest heavily in introductions to new customers. Though it's sometimes hard to imagine with all that has happened in the last five years, this remains Day 1 for ecommerce, and these are the early days of category formation where many customers are forming relationships for the first time. We must work hard to grow the number of customers who shop with us.( 37:00 ) Focus on cost improvement makes it possible for us to afford to lower prices, which drives growth. Growth spreads fixed costs across more sales, reducing cost per unit, which makes possible more price reductions. Customers like this, and it's good for shareholders. Please expect us to repeat this loop.( 47:00 ) Our quantitative understanding of elasticity is short-term. We can estimate what a price reduction will do this week and this quarter. But we cannot numerically estimate the effect that consistently lowering prices will have on our business over five years or ten years or more. Our judgment is that relentlessly returning efficiency improvements and scale economies to customers in the form of lower prices creates a virtuous cycle that leads over the long term to a much larger dollar amount of free cash flow, and thereby to a much more valuable Amazon.( 55:00 ) Our fundamental approach remains the same. Stay heads down, focused on the long term and obsessed over customers. Long-term thinking levers our existing abilities and lets us do new things we couldn't otherwise contemplate. Seek instant gratification and chances are you'll find a crowd there ahead of you. ( 56:00 ) Long-term orientation interacts well with customer obsession. If we can identify a customer need and if we can further develop conviction that that need is meaningful and durable, our approach permits us to work patiently for multiple years to deliver a solution.( 59:00 ) Invention is in our DNA and technology is the fundamental tool we wield to evolve and improve every aspect of the experience we provide our customers.( 1:00:00 ) A dreamy business offering has at least four characteristics. Customers love it, it can grow to very large size, it has strong returns on capital, and it's durable in time-with the potential to endure for decades. When you find one of these get married.( 1:02:00 ) We all know that if you swing for the fences, you're going to strike out a lot, but you're also going to hit some home runs. The difference between baseball and business, however, is that baseball has a truncated outcome distribution. When you swing, no matter how well you connect with the ball, the most runs you can get is four. In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score one thousand runs. This long-tailed distribution of returns is why it's important to be bold. Big winners pay for so many experiments.( 1:10:00) When a memo isn't great, it's not the writer's inability to recognize the high standard, but instead a wrong expectation on scope: they mistakenly believe a high standards, six-page memo can be written in one or two days or even a few hours, when really it might take a week or more! They're trying to perfect a handstand in just two weeks, and we're not coaching them right. The great memos are written and re-written, shared with colleagues who are asked to improve the work, set aside for a couple of days, and then edited again with a fresh mind. They simply can't be done in a day or two. The key point here is that you can improve results through the simple act of teaching scope-that a great memo probably should take a week or more.( 1:12:00 ) Sometimes (often actually) in business, you do know where you're going, and when you do, you can be efficient. Put in place a plan and execute. In contrast, wandering in business is not efficient-but it's also not random. It's guided-by hunch, gut, intuition, curiosity, and powered by a deep conviction that the prize for customers is big enough that it's worth being a little messy and tangential to find our way there. Wandering is an essential counterbalance to efficiency. You need to employ both. The outsized discoveries-the \"nonlinear\" ones-are highly likely to require wandering. ----Founders Notes gives you the ability to tap into the collective knowledge of history's greatest entrepreneurs on demand.

        "description": "Akio Morita was a visionary entrepreneur and co-founder of Sony. Born as the first son and fifteenth-generation heir to a 300-year-old sake-brewing family in Japan, Akio eschewed the traditional path to forge his own legacy in electronics.In post-war Japan, Akio joined forces with Masaru Ibuka to found Sony. They started in a burned-out department store with limited resources—to build their first product they had to buy supplies on the black market. Akio was determined to change the global perception of Japanese goods as poor quality. From day one he set out to build high-quality, differentiated products, targeted at affluent markets. Akio believed in long-term vision over short-term profits, product innovation without market research, and brand building over immediate profits. Against all opposition, including inside of his own company, Akio invented one of the most successful consumer products of all time: The Walkman. It sold over 400 million units and inspired countless other entrepreneurs like Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, James Dyson, and Phil Knight. This episode is what I learned from rereading Akio's classic 1986 autobiography Made In Japan. ----Ramp gives you everything you need to control spend, watch your costs, and optimize your financial operations —all on a single platform.

        "description": "Daniel Ludwig was the richest man in the world and no one knew his name. I've read almost 400 biographies of history's greatest founders and this book is one of my all time favorites. Daniel Ludwig started his company at 19 and was working on it well into his 90s. He built a massive conglomerate of over 200 companies operating in more than 50 countries. Spending the time to learn how he did this is a great investment. This episode will tell you what I learned from rereading The Invisible Billionaire: Daniel Ludwig by Jerry Shields. ----Ramp gives you everything you need to control spend, watch your costs, and optimize your financial operations —all on a single platform. Make history's greatest entrepreneurs proud by going to Ramp and learning how they can help your business control your costs and save more. ----Founders Notes gives you the ability to tap into the collective knowledge of history's greatest entrepreneurs on demand. Use it to supplement the decisions you make in your work.  Get access to Founders Notes here. ----Join my free email newsletter to get my top 10 highlights from every book----EPISODE OUTLINE 1.  Obsessed with privacy, Ludwig pays a major public relations firm fat fees to keep his name out of the papers.2.  An associate speaks of his unlimited ingenuity in dreaming up new ways of doing things.3. Ludwig’s most notable characteristic, besides his imagination and pertinacity, is a lifelong penchant for keeping his mouth shut.4. I'm in this business because I like it. I have no other hobbies.5. Pertinacity: Holding strongly to an opinion, purpose, or course of action, stubbornly or annoyingly persistent.6.  Risk Game: Self Portrait of an Entrepreneur by Francis Greenburger (Founders #243)7. At his peak, he owned more than 200 companies in 50 countries.8. War makes the demand for Ludwig's products and services skyrocket.9.  Hard Drive: Bill Gates and the Making of the Microsoft Empire by James Wallace and Jim Erickson. (Founders #290)10. He did not mellow as he grew richer and older.11. Some years later, the captain of a Ludwig ship made the extravagant mistake of mailing in a report of several pages held together by a paper clip. He received a sharp rebuke for his prodigality: \"We do not pay to send ironmongery by air mail!\"12. Ludwig’s tightfistedness, however, persisted after the Depression, putting him in sharp contrast to such free spenders as Onassis and Niarchos. It also was largely responsible for many of his innovations in the shipbuilding industry.13. Onassis: An Extravagant Life by Frank Brady. (Founders #211)14. Ludwig’s ridding his ships of any feature that did not contribute to profits pleased his own obsessive sense of economy and kept him a step ahead of the competition. When someone asked why he didn't put a grand piano aboard his ships, as Stavros Niarchos did, Ludwig snapped, \"You can't carry oil in a grand piano.\"15. Stay in the game long enough to get lucky.16. The world is a very malleable place.

        "html_description": "<p>Daniel Ludwig was the richest man in the world and no one knew his name. I&#39;ve read almost 400 biographies of history&#39;s greatest founders and this book is one of my all time favorites. Daniel Ludwig started his company at 19 and was working on it well into his 90s. He built a massive conglomerate of over 200 companies operating in more than 50 countries. Spending the time to learn how he did this is a great investment. This episode will tell you what I learned from rereading <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3xTOvkf\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Invisible Billionaire: Daniel Ludwig</a> by Jerry Shields. </p><p>----</p><p><a href=\"https://ramp.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ramp</a> gives you everything you need to control spend, watch your costs, and optimize your financial operations —all on a single platform.

Ludwig’s most notable characteristic, besides his imagination and pertinacity, is a lifelong penchant for keeping his mouth shut.</p><p>4. I&#39;m in this business because I like it. I have no other hobbies.</p><p>5. Pertinacity: Holding strongly to an opinion, purpose, or course of action, stubbornly or annoyingly persistent.</p><p>6.  <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3LmBvZy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Risk Game: Self Portrait of an Entrepreneur</a> by Francis Greenburger (Founders #243)</p><p>7. At his peak, he owned more than 200 companies in 50 countries.</p><p>8. War makes the demand for Ludwig&#39;s products and services skyrocket.</p><p>9.  <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3lxxmd9\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hard Drive: Bill Gates and the Making of the Microsoft Empire</a> by James Wallace and Jim Erickson. (Founders #290)</p><p>10. He did not mellow as he grew richer and older.</p><p>11. Some years later, the captain of a Ludwig ship made the extravagant mistake of mailing in a report of several pages held together by a paper clip. He received a sharp rebuke for his prodigality: &#34;We do not pay to send ironmongery by air mail!&#34;</p><p>12. Ludwig’s tightfistedness, however, persisted after the Depression, putting him in sharp contrast to such free spenders as Onassis and Niarchos. It also was largely responsible for many of his innovations in the shipbuilding industry.</p><p>13. <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3p8dooQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">Onassis: An Extravagant Life</a> by Frank Brady. (Founders #211)</p><p>14. Ludwig’s ridding his ships of any feature that did not contribute to profits pleased his own obsessive sense of economy and kept him a step ahead of the competition. When someone asked why he didn&#39;t put a grand piano aboard his ships, as Stavros Niarchos did, Ludwig snapped, &#34;You can&#39;t carry oil in a grand piano.&#34;</p><p>15. Stay in the game long enough to get lucky.</p><p>16. The world is a very malleable place. If you know what you want, and you go for it with maximum energy and drive and passion, the world will often reconfigure itself around you much more quickly and easily than you would think.  <a href=\"https://a16z.com/2015/01/09/pmarca-blog-ebook/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Pmarca Blog Archive Ebook</a> by Marc Andreessen (Founders #50)</p><p>17.

He sold fruit at his father’s grocery store in grade school and sold shoes out of the trunk of his car in college. After failing to sell pizza franchises he tried real estate and insurance. He never met a high risk deal he didn’t like. Jerry got pitched a deal to drill for oil that everyone else had already said no to. Jerry said yes. That well made $4 million. He hit again on the next 14 wells. Jerry decided to drill for natural gas next. He drills 200 wells. He hit on 199 of them. He sells that company for $175 million. He has $90 million in the bank. He buys the Dallas Cowboys for $140 million. 75 other people had the opportunity to buy the team and said no. He empties his bank account and borrows $50 million at steep interest rates. The year before Jerry bought the team the Cowboys lost $9 million. Financial advisors told Jerry that the Cowboys were ridiculously overpriced and that he was committing financial suicide. Within a few years the team is printing $30 million a year in profit. The Dallas Cowboys are worth $10 billion today. This episode is what I leaned from reading King of the Cowboys: The Life and Times of Jerry Jones by Jim Dent. ----Ramp gives you everything you need to control spend, watch your costs, and optimize your financial operations —all on a single platform.

        "description": "Amancio Ortega is one of the wealthiest people in the world. Ortega is the founder of Inditex, a pioneer of fast fashion, an entrepreneur with over 60 years of experience, and has created a business model that is studied in universities that he could not access. His life story is inspiring, educational, and full of valuable ideas for future generations of founders. This episode is what I learned from reading This is Amancio Ortega: The Man Who Created Zara by Covadonga O'Shea. ----Ramp gives you everything you need to control spend, watch your costs, and optimize your financial operations —all on a single platform. Make history's greatest entrepreneurs proud by going to Ramp and learning how they can help your business control your costs and save more. ----Join my free email newsletter to get my top 10 highlights from every book----Notes and highlights from the episode:  I remembered a comment that Luis Miguel Dominguin made to me years ago, when he was at the peak of his glory and his son, still a child, played in the garden of his house. \"This child will never be a bullfighter. To face a bull you have to go hungry.”  The important thing is to set goals in life and put all your soul into fulfilling them.  I have dreamed of growing the company since I was nobody.  We gave it every day. My priority has always been the company, and I have committed myself to it, with full dedication, from day one.  Ortega is a man of mission. He is so convinced of what he is and what he has to do.  I was convinced that I had to dominate the customer.  Ortega starts with the customer and work backwards: “I am going to manufacture what the customer wants.”  I met Ortega when Zara did not exist. He only had the factories. In those years when nobody thought about technology within our sector, in which there was almost no computer science or mobile phones, he wanted to have a good team in technology.  He built a groundbreaking and avant-garde textile distribution company.  Inditex's business is centered around one simple premise – to be quick at responding to the market.  Their main advantage: an astonishing ability to detect fashion trends, assimilate them, and make them a reality on the hanger at a bargain price, and all in less than 15 days.  Ortega wanted to integrate design and manufacturing first, then complete the chain with distribution and sales in his own stores, turning the customer into his source of privileged information and not just the receiver of a commodity.  I refuse to recognize that there are impossibilities. I cannot discover that any one knows enough about anything on this earth definitely to say what is and what is not possible. — Henry Ford  There are no mature sectors where everything is already discovered, but rather companies or managers with closed minds who resist innovation.  Logistics is a fundamental part of the circle that completes Inditex’s vertical integration process. Inventory control in all locations around the world is as important as getting the design right and producing in a short time; that's why Inditex has invested time, effort, and a lot of money in establishing logistics centers with the latest technologies.  Traditionally, the seller ensures high margins at the beginning of each season, but endures several months of discounts to get rid of stock; the customer knows, therefore, that in the long run they will get the same items at lower prices. Ortega's company renews its clothes in stores around the world every week and twice weekly in Europe. The buyer knows that they will always find new items, but probably won't be able to get what they tried on seven days ago. In this way, customers understand that if they see something they like, they have to buy it immediately, because in a few days it will no longer be in the store. It's about creating an atmosphere of scarcity and opportunity.  Ortega has created a business model that is studied in universities to which he could not access.  I consider myself a worker who is immensely fortunate to have done what he wanted in life and to continue doing it.  It's the most beautiful company in the world.  I want a company with a soul.  Ortega stayed focused on his one great objective: To enable the entire world to dress well.  Ortega refuses to settle halfway to excellence.  He is a man with a lot of personal charm because he is not false. He does not have ulterior motives. He can be very tough, impulsive, very sure of himself, but very truthful.  Ortega does not like to lead sitting in a chair.  He has never liked praise. More than once I've told him: 'What a beautiful collection, how happy the customers are!', and he always interrupts me and asks me: 'Now tell me what's wrong.”  When asked on his advice for future generations of entrepreneurs: “The first thing is that you like what you are doing, that you are passionate about your work. I insist on this idea because it is very important. It has to be something that you would almost pay to do.”  Simplicity is the heritage of geniuses.   ----“I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out.

You can search all my notes and highlights from every book I've ever read for the podcast. Get access to Founders Notes here. ----Join my free email newsletter to get my top 10 highlights from every book----Notes and highlights from the episode: —He had unlimited energy, was stubborn, had a temper, was supremely arrogant and he did more to transform the northern frontier of the United States than any other single individual.—One of the things he learned from history and biography: The power of one dynamic individual: Like so many other nineteenth-century youths, young Jim Hill fell under the spell of Napoleon. He came to believe in the strength of will, the power of one dynamic individual to change the world, the conquering hero. (He says that the railroad entrepreneurs conquered the distance between remote communities in the American west)—He accustomed himself to handle a large workload.—If you want to know whether you are destined to be a success or a failure in life, you can easily find out. The test is simple and it is infallible: Are you able to save money? If not, drop out. You will lose. You may think not, but you will lose as sure as you live. The seed of success is not in you. –James J. Hill—He held people’s attention as he engaged them in characteristic rapid-fire, highly animated conversation, gesturing expansively and driving home his point with jabbing motions of his hands—the embodiment of high energy.—He worked incredibly hard, sometimes laboring late into the night, falling asleep at the desk, then getting up for a swim in the river and a cup of black coffee, then going back to work.—“Rebates existed in other industries. I just applied them to oil.” Rockefeller said. [Don’t copy the what, copy the how]  —John D: The Founding Father of the Rockefellers by David Freeman Hawke. (Founders #254)—\"The very best employee at any job at any level of responsibility is the person who generally believes that this is their last job working for someone. The next thing they'll start will be their own. — Max Levchin in The Founders: The Story of PayPal and the Entrepreneurs Who Shaped Silicon Valley by Jimmy Soni. (Founders #233)—Hill drank little, worked hard, and confined his socializing to respectable settings. As always, he read incessantly. He permitted himself few distractions in his relentless drive to achieve wealth and status.—Inefficiency disturbs him greatly.—James J. Hill loved eliminating steps.—Genius has the fewest moving parts.—Hill limited the number of details. Then he makes every detail perfect.—Hill called vertical integration, rational integration.—Hill always gets out quickly in front of the emerging trend.—Hill had an entirely pragmatic business personality. When competition suited him in a market, he competed fiercely. But when competition became wasteful to him, he did not hesitate to end it, even if this meant joining with old enemies and creating a monopoly.—Hill was making profits owning steamboats. Then a competitor from Canada starts running the same route and the rates and profits dwindle. Hill discovers a neglected maritime law that prohibited foreign ships from operating in American waters. Hill then persuades the US Treasury Department to enforce the law against his competitor. The competitor has to transfer ownership to an American. After that Hill then merges with that competitor and forges another monopoly.—This railroad is my monument. — James J Hill—As man emerged into history, he became a road maker; the better the road, the more advanced his development. — James J. Hill.—By 1885 Railroads brought in twice the revenue than the federal government.Railroads were the nations largest employer.The railroaders were the largest private land holders in the country.They owned more than 10% of land in the United States.—Hill identified an opportunity hiding in plain sight: Unlike most who viewed the Saint Paul and Pacific as a near-worthless derelict, Hill viewed it as a miracle waiting to happen, a potentially wondrous enterprise simply lacking competent leadership. He studied the road constantly, reading every scrap of information he could find about it and boring anyone who would listen with endless detail as to what it could one day be.—He possessed a priceless advantage compared with most other nineteenth-century rail titans. Rather than coming from the outside world of finance, as most of them did, he arose from the inside world of freighting and transportation, and he knew this world in all its complexities. He was about to demonstrate how certain well-established, regional capitalists on the frontier could challenge and even best larger eastern interests.—Being obsessed is an edge. Hill was obsessed getting control of the bankrupt Saint Paul & Pacific rail line:  Hill, who knew the road better than anyone else, constantly argued to his friends, the potential prize defied description. He seemed completely fixated on the project. Many years later, his friend recalled that Jim had spoken of it to him “probably several hundred times” during the mid-1870s.—James J. Hill finds what he is best at in the world at, at 40 years old, in a field where he had no direct experience.—“It pays to be where the money is spent” — James J Hill—James J. Hill was very easy to interface with. He had an easy to understand organizing principle for his company. Hills credo: What we want is the best possible line, shortest distance, lowest grades, and least curvature that we can build.—He had appreciation for those who had dirt underneath their fingernails.—Many observers would later compare Hill with Villard. The comparison was inevitable. “While Hill was building carefully and checking his costs minutely Villard built in ignorance of costs.” Like other transcontinental plungers, Villard did in fact build rapidly and poorly, much of his main line would later have to be torn up and rebuilt. He had rushed to get the massive land grants. Amid mounting deficits and acrimony, Villard was then forced to resign the presidency of the NP in 1884.—Find what you are good at and pound away at it forever.—He simply could not delegate authority and live with the outcome.—Hill on how to build a railroad: Work, hard work, intelligent work, and then more work. — James J Hill.—They managed the finances of the railroad in a highly conservative and prudent manner.  Hill advocated and practiced a policy of plowing large percentages of profits directly back into the property, knowing that the best defense against invading railroads was a better-built system that could operate at lower rates.—Give me Swedes, snuff and whiskey, and I'll build a railroad through hell. — James J. Hill—From the Hour of Fate: James J. Hill had built the Great Northern with deliberate thrift and brutal efficiency. His railroad would become among the most profitable in the Northwest. He didn't need JP Morgan the way other railroad executives did. (Financial strength was kryptonite to JP Morgan)—He cared most about freight, never frills.—The life of James J. Hill certainly demonstrates the impact one willful individual can have on the course of history.—I’ve made my mark on the surface of the earth and they can’t wipe it out. — James J Hill.----“I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out.

        "description": "What I learned from reading Leading By Design: The Ikea Story by Ingvar Kamprad and Bertil Torekull and The Testament of a Furniture Dealer by Ingvar Kamprad.----Ramp gives you everything you need to control spend, watch your costs, and optimize your financial operations —all on a single platform.

You can search all my notes and highlights from every book I've ever read for the podcast. Get access to Founders Notes here. ----Join my free email newsletter to get my top 10 highlights from every book----Notes and highlights from the episode: Ingvar works on IKEA from the time he is 17 until he dies at 91.The Testament of a Furniture Dealer by Ingvar Kamprad (1976) is a sermon on the culture of IKEA  IKEA’s common goal: We have decided once and for all to side with the many. IKEA will offer a wide range of well-designed furniture at prices so low that as many people as possible will be able to afford them.Billy Durant (founder of General Motors) describing Henry Ford’s one single idea: Durant noted that Ford “was in favor of keeping prices down to the lowest possible point, giving to the multitude the benefit of cheap transportation.” — Billy Durant: Creator of General Motors by Lawrence Gustin Something Ingvar repeats: We will do it a different way.This will not be easy. We must demand much from ourselves.IKEA must have low prices. Ingvar’s dedication to that idea is total. Without low costs we can never accomplish our purpose. The principle can never be compromised: Our policy of serving the many can never be changed.If you are not enthusiastic about your job, one-third of your life goes to waste.Wasting resources is a mortal sin at IKEA.Expensive solutions to any kind of problem are usually the work of mediocrity.Planning is often synonymous with bureaucracy. Exaggerated planning is the most common cause of corporate death.Simple routines have a greater impact. Simplicity in our behavior gives us strength.No reports. No committees. Just done. — Elon in the early days of SpaceX Liftoff: Elon Musk and the Desperate Early Days That Launched SpaceX by Eric Berger. (Founders #369) We dare to do things differently.You had to remember he'd been picking up the best ideas from all around the country. — Copy This!: How I turned Dyslexia, ADHD, and 100 square feet into a company called Kinkos by Paul Orfalea. (Founders #181) Concentration is important to our success. The general who divides his resources will invariably be defeated.We can never do everything, everywhere, all at the same time.We must concentrate for maximum impact, often with small means.Concentration means that at certain vital stages we are forced to neglect otherwise important aspects.Constant meetings and group discussions are often the result of unwillingness or inability on the part of the person in charge to make decisions.Only those who are asleep make no mistakes. Making mistakes is the privilege of the active.The fear of making mistakes is the root of bureaucracy and the enemy of development.It is always the mediocre people who are negative, who spend their time proving that they were not wrong. The strong person is always positive and looks forward.Happiness is not reaching your goal. Happiness is being on the way. It is our wonderful fate to be just at the beginning (He said this when he was already 33 years into running his company!)Bear in mind that time is your most important resource. You can do so much in ten minutes. Ten minutes, once gone, are gone for good. You can never get them back. Divide your life into ten-minute units and sacrifice as few of them as possible in meaningless activity.Let us continue to be a group of positive fanatics who stubbornly and persistently refuse to accept the impossible.Ingvar’s family had to rent out all the rooms in their house to strangers to make ends meet.Selling things became an obsession. Trading was in my blood.By 1997 IKEA had mailed out over 100 million catalogs.Ingvar was the first person in the furniture industry to combine a mail order catalog and a furniture store.Cost awareness was to be IKEA’s anthem.Ingvar’s greatest regret was working so much that he missed out on seeing his 3 son’s grow up: Childhood does not allow itself to be reconquered.I have not been able to avoid severe losses. Both fiascoes and triumphs have marked the history of the business.Ingvar would rather his employees make mistakes than be idle.The wave Ingvar rode: Sweden’s housing construction boom. More than 1 million new apartments were built after the war. All of them needed well designed, affordable furniture. The way IKEA was described by its competitors: A monster with seven heads: “If you cut off one, another soon grows.”A golden rule of IKEA: Regard every problem as a possibility. The boycott by the National Association of Furniture Dealers was the best thing that ever happened to IKEA. It forced IKEA down a path of product differentiation and helped them stumble upon the idea of flat packing and self assembled furniture.The laws of IKEA since birth:  -A good cash reserve must always be ensured.-All property must be owned.-All expansion is to be largely self-financed.-There shall be no boasting.We push cost awareness at all levels with almost manic frenzy.Ingvar believes in the ability to wait out difficulties.Ingvar believes in gathering unfiltered intel from the front lines. He makes unannounced store visits and spends time talking to the employees unloading furniture and helping customers.The day he is free of IKEA life for him will no longer be worth living. He loves it, aways wants to lie as close as possible to it, and never tires of improving it.A demon in me says I have so much to do. I am never satisfied. Something tells me what I’m doing at the moment has to be done better tomorrow.Behind this multinational tycoon is a country boy with a fierce sense of being an underdog.He has a peasants distrust of a favorable destiny that keeps his feet on the ground.----“I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out.

IKEA will offer a wide range of well-designed furniture at prices so low that as many people as possible will be able to afford them.</p><p>Billy Durant (founder of General Motors) describing Henry Ford’s one single idea: Durant noted that Ford “was in favor of keeping prices down to the lowest possible point, giving to the multitude the benefit of cheap transportation.” — <a href=\"https://amzn.to/48IH9Br\" rel=\"nofollow\">Billy Durant: Creator of General Motors</a> by Lawrence Gustin </p><p>Something Ingvar repeats: We will do it a different way.</p><p>This will not be easy. We must demand much from ourselves.</p><p>IKEA must have low prices. Ingvar’s dedication to that idea is total. Without low costs we can never accomplish our purpose. The principle can never be compromised: Our policy of serving the many can never be changed.</p><p>If you are not enthusiastic about your job, one-third of your life goes to waste.</p><p>Wasting resources is a mortal sin at IKEA.</p><p>Expensive solutions to any kind of problem are usually the work of mediocrity.</p><p>Planning is often synonymous with bureaucracy. Exaggerated planning is the most common cause of corporate death.</p><p>Simple routines have a greater impact. Simplicity in our behavior gives us strength.</p><p>No reports. No committees. Just done. — Elon in the early days of SpaceX <a href=\"https://amzn.to/36nCdGk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Liftoff: Elon Musk and the Desperate Early Days That Launched SpaceX</a> by Eric Berger. (Founders #369) </p><p>We dare to do things differently.</p><p>You had to remember he&#39;d been picking up the best ideas from all around the country. — <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3hNAnBX\" rel=\"nofollow\">Copy This!: How I turned Dyslexia, ADHD, and 100 square feet into a company called Kinkos</a> by Paul Orfalea. (Founders #181) </p><p>Concentration is important to our success. The general who divides his resources will invariably be defeated.</p><p>We can never do everything, everywhere, all at the same time.</p><p>We must concentrate for maximum impact, often with small means.</p><p>Concentration means that at certain vital stages we are forced to neglect otherwise important aspects.</p><p>Constant meetings and group discussions are often the result of unwillingness or inability on the part of the person in charge to make decisions.</p><p>Only those who are asleep make no mistakes. Making mistakes is the privilege of the active.</p><p>The fear of making mistakes is the root of bureaucracy and the enemy of development.</p><p>It is always the mediocre people who are negative, who spend their time proving that they were not wrong. The strong person is always positive and looks forward.</p><p>Happiness is not reaching your goal. Happiness is being on the way. It is our wonderful fate to be just at the beginning (He said this when he was already 33 years into running his company!)</p><p>Bear in mind that time is your most important resource. You can do so much in ten minutes. Ten minutes, once gone, are gone for good. You can never get them back. Divide your life into ten-minute units and sacrifice as few of them as possible in meaningless activity.</p><p>Let us continue to be a group of positive fanatics who stubbornly and persistently refuse to accept the impossible.</p><p>Ingvar’s family had to rent out all the rooms in their house to strangers to make ends meet.</p><p>Selling things became an obsession. Trading was in my blood.</p><p>By 1997 IKEA had mailed out over 100 million catalogs.</p><p>Ingvar was the first person in the furniture industry to combine a mail order catalog and a furniture store.</p><p>Cost awareness was to be IKEA’s anthem.</p><p>Ingvar’s greatest regret was working so much that he missed out on seeing his 3 son’s grow up: Childhood does not allow itself to be reconquered.</p><p>I have not been able to avoid severe losses. Both fiascoes and triumphs have marked the history of the business.</p><p>Ingvar would rather his employees make mistakes than be idle.</p><p>The wave Ingvar rode: Sweden’s housing construction boom. More than 1 million new apartments were built after the war. All of them needed well designed, affordable furniture. </p><p>The way IKEA was described by its competitors: A monster with seven heads: “If you cut off one, another soon grows.”</p><p>A golden rule of IKEA: Regard every problem as a possibility. The boycott by the National Association of Furniture Dealers was the best thing that ever happened to IKEA. It forced IKEA down a path of product differentiation and helped them stumble upon the idea of flat packing and self assembled furniture.</p><p>The laws of IKEA since birth:  </p><p>-A good cash reserve must always be ensured.</p><p>-All property must be owned.</p><p>-All expansion is to be largely self-financed.</p><p>-There shall be no boasting.</p><p>We push cost awareness at all levels with almost manic frenzy.</p><p>Ingvar believes in the ability to wait out difficulties.</p><p>Ingvar believes in gathering unfiltered intel from the front lines. He makes unannounced store visits and spends time talking to the employees unloading furniture and helping customers.</p><p>The day he is free of IKEA life for him will no longer be worth living. He loves it, aways wants to lie as close as possible to it, and never tires of improving it.</p><p>A demon in me says I have so much to do. I am never satisfied. Something tells me what I’m doing at the moment has to be done better tomorrow.</p><p>Behind this multinational tycoon is a country boy with a fierce sense of being an underdog.</p><p>He has a peasants distrust of a favorable destiny that keeps his feet on the ground.</p><p>----</p><p>“I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out.

He wanted to learn from their mistakes so as not to repeat them.—Elon announces that he wants to start his own rocket company and I do remember a lot of chuckling, some laughter, people saying things like, ‘Save your money kid, and go sit on the beach.’” The kid was not amused. If anything, the doubts expressed at this meeting, and by some of his confidants, energized him more.—Musk was a siren, calling brilliant young minds to SpaceX with an irresistible song. He offered an intoxicating brew of vision, charisma, audacious goals, resources.—When they needed something, he wrote the check. In meetings, he helped solve their most challenging technical problems. When the hour was late, he could often be found right there, beside them, working away.—The iterative approach begins with a goal and almost immediately leaps into concept designs, bench tests, and prototypes. The mantra with this approach is build and test early, find failures, and adapt. This is what SpaceX engineers and technicians did.—\"Here was a man who was not interested in experts. He meets me, he thinks to himself, 'Here is a bright kid, let's employ him.' And he does. He risks little with the possibility of gaining much. It is *exactly* what I now do at DysonThis attitude to employment extended to [Jeremy] Fry's thinking in everything, including engineering. He did not, when an idea came to him, sit down and process it through pages of calculations; *he didn't argue it through with anyone; he just went out and built it.* When I came to him to say, 'I've had an idea,' he would offer no more advice than to say, 'You know where the workshop is, go and do it.'  'But we'll need to weld this thing,' I would protest.Well then, get a welder and weld it.' When I asked if we shouldn't talk to sure someone about, say, hydrodynamics, he would say, 'The lake is down there, the Land Rover is over there, take a plank of wood down to the lake, tow it behind a boat and look at what happens.' Now, this was not a modus operandi that I had encountered before. College had taught me to revere experts and expertise. Fry ridiculed all that; as far as he was concerned, *with enthusiasm and intelligence anything was possible.* It was mind-blowing. No research, no preliminary sketches. If it didn't work one way he would just try it another way, until it did. And as we proceeded I could see that we were getting on extremely quickly.  *The root principle was to do things your way.* It didn’t matter how other people did it. It didn’t matter if it could be done better.  As long as it works, and it is exciting, people will follow you.\"      — Against the Odds: An Autobiography by James Dyson by James Dyson (Founders #300)—Elon personally interviewed the first 3,000 employees of SpaceX.—His people had to be brilliant. They had to be hardworking. And there could be no nonsense.—SpaceX operated at its own speed.—Pony Express ad: “Wanted: Young, skinny, wiry fellows not over eighteen. Must be expert riders, willing to risk death daily. Orphans preferred.”—I’ve never met a man so laser focused on his vision for what he wanted. He’s very intense, and he’s intimidating as hell.—SpaceX had juice with the best students in space engineering. The freedom to innovate and resources to go fast summoned the best engineers in the land.—Talent wins over experience and an entrepreneurial culture over heritage.—He always made the most difficult decisions. He did not put off problems, but rather tackled the hardest ones first. And he had a vision for how aerospace could be done faster and for less money.—He didn’t want to fail, but he wasn’t afraid of it.—The speed SpaceX worked at relative to its peers could be jarring.—No job is beneath us.—No committees. No reports. Just done.—Most of all he channeled an intense force to move things forward. Elon wants to get shit done.—SpaceX likes to operate on its own terms and its own timeline.—90% of the book is SpaceX failing.—Elon spent much of the flight poring over books written about early rocket scientists and their efforts. He seemed intent to understand the mistakes they had made and learn from them.—SpaceX is in this for the long haul and, come hell or high water, we are going to make this work.—Who knows your customers? Find the person that knows your customers and then hire that person to sell your product to them.—No work about work, just work. Shotwell wrote a plan of action for sales. Musk took one look at it and told her that he did not care about plans. Just get on with the job. “I was like, oh, OK, this is refreshing. I don’t have to write up a damn plan,” Shotwell recalled. Here was her first real taste of Musk’s management style. Don’t talk about doing things, just do things.—Within its first three years, SpaceX had sued three of its biggest rivals in the launch industry, gone against the Air Force with the proposed United Launch Alliance merger, and protested a NASA contract. Elon Musk was not walking on eggshells on the way to orbit. He was breaking a lot of eggs.—A Pegasus launch cost between $ 26 and $ 28 million. SpaceX’s price was $6 million. Musk wanted it front and center on the company’s website. This sort of transparency was radical at the time.----“I have listened to every episode released and look forward to every episode that comes out.
